<!-- IDEA


    ok, so, what if there were cards just like the ones I have drawn. But make them real divs instead of pseudo
    elements. On the right hand side, the cards would show with some little snippet of text in them like a "subject"
    and on the right hand side it showed more content on the left that went into more detail about what was shown on
    the card. The cards could animate in from the left side of the screen when the page loads. When a card is clicked
    it will go off the scree or shuffle to the back. the side of each card could have a little title
    on the edge or when you hovered over it so that you could click on a specific thing if you wanted to or just
    click through all of the menu buttons if you wanted.
